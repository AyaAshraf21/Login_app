# Login_app

Hello everyone ✨♥️

I am glad to share with you:-

My new project : Login App 
Programming language: QT C++


Features: 

1- you can choose if you want to register, login , change password or exit

2- "Register" if you don't have an account , Therefore if you choose register and you already have an account you will be transferred to login window

3- when you press on "register" , a window will appear in which you enter your data There are some restrictions on data entry
 •ID must be numerical
• username must be alphabetical and "_" is optional 
• email must be as "example@domain.com" • phone number must be made up of 11 numbers starts with 010 , 011 ,  012 or 015

• password should be at least 8 characters include : Digits , uppercase , lowercase and special characters

•And of course, "repeat password" should be the same as the "password"

When you press "register"   , a text will appear that informs you of either the success of the registration, and in this case your data will be saved or there is something wrong in your data


4- "Login" if you already have an account , Therefore if you choose login and you don't have an account you will be transferred to register window

5- when you press "login" a window will appear in which you entry your id and password

if you press "login" also a text will appear that informs you of either the success of login , or there is something wrong in your data


6-  if you press "Change password" , you must login first 
after login ,  you will be transferred to change password window 

to change password you must enter your id ,  the new password and repeat password
There are also restrictions on entering the password, as we mentioned earlier in the "Register" 

7- "Exit" to close the program

Finally, I am glad that I finished this project 
I learned a lot from it by working with data , encoding and decoding it♥️✨
